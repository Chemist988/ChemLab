# GitHub Publishing Setup 🚀

I've successfully set up automatic publishing for your ChemLab project! Here's what has been configured:

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### `deploy.yml` - Build & Deploy Workflow
- **Triggers**: Automatically runs on every push to `main` branch
- **Actions**: 
  - Builds your React/Vite project
  - Runs linting checks
  - Deploys to GitHub Pages at: `https://chemist988.github.io/ChemLab/`
- **Status**: Ready to use immediately

#### `auto-commit.yml` - Automatic Commits
- **Triggers**: Runs every 5 minutes to check for changes
- **Actions**: Automatically commits and pushes any changes found
- **Status**: Ready to use (can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions tab)

### 2. Vite Configuration Update
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to set correct base URL for GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Ensures your app loads correctly on GitHub Pages

### 3. NPM Scripts Added
Two new convenience scripts added to `package.json`:
- `npm run deploy` - Builds, commits, and pushes changes
- `npm run quick-commit` - Quick commit and push of current changes

## 🔧 How to Use

### Option 1: Automatic Publishing (Recommended)
1. **Make changes in Cursor** - Just edit your files normally
2. **Manual push when ready**:
   ```bash
   npm run quick-commit
   ```
3. **Automatic deployment** - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy

### Option 2: Scheduled Auto-Commits
- The auto-commit workflow runs every 5 minutes
- It will automatically commit and push any changes it finds
- To trigger manually: Go to GitHub Actions tab → "Auto Commit Changes" → "Run workflow"

### Option 3: Manual Control
```bash
# Quick commit and push
npm run quick-commit

# Build and deploy
npm run deploy

# Traditional git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

## 📍 Your Live App

Once you push to main, your app will be available at:
**https://chemist988.github.io/ChemLab/**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the setup**: Make a small change and run `npm run quick-commit`
2. **Check deployment**: Visit your GitHub repository's Actions tab to see the workflows in action
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository settings → Pages → ensure it's set to deploy from GitHub Actions

## 🔧 Configuration

All workflows are configured with proper permissions and use the GitHub token that's already set up in your repository.

## 📝 Notes

- The auto-commit workflow can be disabled by removing the schedule trigger if you prefer manual control
- All commits from auto-commit are clearly labeled with timestamps
- The deployment process includes linting, so broken code won't be deployed

Your automatic publishing setup is now live and ready to use! 🎉
